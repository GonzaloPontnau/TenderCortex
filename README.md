## Live Demo Architecture

This project is deployed as a **production-ready Monorepo** with a decoupled frontend and backend:

| Layer | Technology | Hosting | URL |
|-------|------------|---------|-----|
| **Frontend** | React (Vite) + TypeScript | Vercel | [\[API URL\]](https://multi-agent-rfp-orchestrator.vercel.app)  |
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python) | Render | [\[API URL\]](https://multi-agent-rfp-orchestrator-backend.onrender.com) |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant (In-Memory) | Embedded | N/A |

### Performance Note

> **Important:** The backend runs on a **Free Tier** instance on Render. Please allow **up to 50 seconds** for the server to wake up on the first request. Subsequent requests will be fast.

### Privacy by Design

This system implements a **zero-persistence architecture** for maximum user privacy:

- **In-Memory Vector Store:** The Qdrant database runs entirely in RAM. No data is written to disk.
- **Ephemeral Sessions:** All uploaded documents and embeddings are automatically purged when the session ends or the server restarts.
- **No Tracking:** We do not store, log, or retain any user data.

This design ensures that your sensitive tender documents are never persisted, making it ideal for evaluating confidential procurements.

## Overview

**TenderCortex** is an advanced multi-agent system designed to automate the analysis and response to public tenders and procurement documents. By leveraging a multi-agent architecture with specialized domain sub-agents, the system ingests documents (PDFs), retrieves relevant context using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and synthesizes professional, compliant responses.

The core orchestration is handled by **LangGraph**, ensuring a robust state machine flow that includes quality auditing and iterative refinement of answers.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with specialized agents for Legal, Financial, Technical, and Timeline domains.
*   **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically classifies inquiries to route them to the most appropriate domain specialist.
*   **RAG Pipeline**: Semantic search over ingested documents to ground answers in factual data.
*   **Quality Assurance**: Built-in auditor agent that validates responses against quality standards before delivery.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Self-correction mechanism where the auditor can reject answers, triggering a refinement loop.
*   **Modern Stack**: Built with FastAPI, React, and leading AI orchestration tools.

## Architecture

The system operates on a state graph that coordinates the interaction between retrieval, reasoning, and generation.

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Orchestration** | LangGraph | State machine management for multi-agent workflows. |
| **LLM Inference** | Groq API | Fast inference using `openai/gpt-oss-120b` by default (overridable via `GROQ_MODEL`). |
| **Embeddings** | HuggingFace Inference API | Cloud-based embeddings (saves RAM on free tier). |
| **Backend** | FastAPI | High-performance async Python framework. |
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript | Modern, type-safe UI with TailwindCSS. |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant (In-Memory) | Zero-maintenance vector storage for ephemeral deployments. |
| **Ingestion** | Docling | PDF extraction and document processing. |

## Strategic Value for Enterprise Leaders

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create these **Multi-Agent systems** at the corporate and enterprise levels. This system is not just software; it's a scalable and autonomous workforce designed to boost your team's productivity.

### Why Integrate Multi-Agent Systems?

*   **Operational Agility**: Reduce tender response cycles from weeks to hours. Our agents work in parallel—parsing, retrieving, and drafting—allowing your human experts to focus purely on high-value strategy and review.
*   **Risk Mitigation**: The dedicated **Risk Sentinel** and **Legal Auditor** agents ensure every proposal adheres strictly to your corporate compliance and risk frameworks, eliminating costly oversight errors.
*   **Cost Efficiency**: Deploy a 24/7 digital workforce that scales instantly with demand, dramatically lowering the operational overhead of pre-sales and technical writing.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions**: Transform your historical repository of tenders into an active knowledge asset, ensuring consistency and leveraging past successes for future wins.
